# installinux

## installation
* execute install.sh
* take a look at /etc/installunux/installinux.conf
* run /usr/share/installinux/html/scripts/apply_config.sh

## debian package
coming soon (hopefully)

## networking management
* it should be possibile to see ALL the network interfaces in the system and assign one (or more?) IP address
* we need interface assignment (eth0 to wan, eth1 to lan...)
* for wireless interfaces we should have a list of credentials for wan's wlan (SSID and PSK)
* we should manage an optional wireless AP interface
